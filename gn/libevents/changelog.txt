-- Change module contents.

Rationale:
  Decouple implementation of events from frame formats.
  Assimilate different types of events in a general Event object.
  Use a common interface, e.g. function mkevent() in if_events, to make any type of event.
  Provide examples of use in separate modules, e.g. evtimer.py, efstrframes.py, efvrames80211.py

General modules:
  - events.py: functions and classes for events.
  - if_events.py: interface for events, contains mkevent(), imports modules for different types of events; to be modified for new types of events, new import and modification of mkevent() accordingly.

Specific modules, for different types of events, frames, etc.:
  - evframes80211.py: uses IEEE 802.11 frames.
  - evstrframes.py: uses simple string frames, for testing use of events in other modules.
  - evtimer.py: timer frames.

-- Adjust all modules using events
  - changed to new modules names
  - changet to access data as event.ev_dc['src_addr'] etc.
  - run tests, results comparable to previous versions, a couple of errors persist, also found in previous version.
