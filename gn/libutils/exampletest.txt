### exampletest.txt: doctest file for exampletest.py
###

This file can be directly invoked for testing with command
  python -m doctest exampletest.txt
If all tests are passed, no messages are printed.

In this doctest file, all lines are considered comments except when started by '>>>'. Lines started by '>>>' are excecuted by the python interpreter.

The doctest file structure:
  command: a line preceded by '>>>'
  output: the expected output of the former command.
  blankline: indicates end of expected output. If a blank line is part of the output, then write it as <BLANKLINE>. A line started by '>>>' is also understood as an end of the former output.

>>> print "Hello World"
Hello World
>>> print "Hello World\n"
Hello World
<BLANKLINE>
